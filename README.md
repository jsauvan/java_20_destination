I'm ready to assist. However, I must point out that there is no Java code provided to migrate and validate. The file `/README.md` contains Markdown text and not Java code.

Please provide the actual Java file that needs to be migrated, and I'll be happy to assist you with the task. I will update the syntax to use modern Java 20 features where applicable, without introducing new classes, methods, or changing the structure of the original code.
